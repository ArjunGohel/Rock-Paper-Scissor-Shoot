# Rock Paper Scissor Shoot

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 7th grader, and I'm super excited to share my first GitHub project with you. It's called "Rock Paper Scissor Shoot"!

## About the Game

"Rock Paper Scissor Shoot" is a classic game that you can play right in your command prompt or terminal. It's a cool way to practice coding in Python while having fun!

## How to Play

1. First, make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your computer. Don't worry; it's super easy! Just click on the green "Code" button and copy the link, then run this command in your terminal:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissor-shoot.git
    ```

    Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

3. Go to the project folder:

    ```
    cd rock-paper-scissor-shoot
    ```

4. Run the game by typing:

    ```
    python rock_paper_scissor.py
    ```

5. Now, you get to choose either "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissor." Type your choice and hit Enter!

6. The game will count down, and when it shouts "Shoot!" the computer will make its choice too.

7. The game will tell you if you won, lost, or if it's a tie! Can you beat the computer?
